## Rust conventions

what are the rust conventions for directory structure for a binary project?
-
...
One common convention is to organize the source code files under a src/ directory. Within src/, it's common to create a top-level module with the same name as the binary crate, and place the binary's main function in a file named main.rs. Other modules can be organized within subdirectories under src/.

For example, if your binary project is named myapp, you might create the following directory structure:

css
Copy code
myapp/
├── src/
│   ├── main.rs
│   ├── some_module.rs
│   └── some_submodule/
│       ├── another_module.rs
│       └── yet_another_module.rs
└── Cargo.toml
Another convention is to place configuration files and assets such as images or templates under a resources/ or assets/ directory.

I usually store my data models in a separate folder/module in go. How would that translate here or is there already a different idiomatic rust way for that
-
In Rust, it's common to define data models and types in separate modules, often in their own subdirectory within the src/ directory. You can create a directory named models/ or types/ and place your data model modules in there.

For example, you might have a directory structure like this:

css
Copy code
myapp/
├── src/
│   ├── main.rs
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── user.rs
│   │   └── post.rs
│   └── lib.rs
└── Cargo.toml
In this example, the models/ directory contains two Rust modules, user.rs and post.rs, which define data models for users and posts, respectively.

You can then use these data models in your application code by importing them with a use statement. For example, if you have a function in main.rs that creates a new user, you might write:


use myapp::models::user::User;

fn main() {
    let new_user = User::new("Alice", "alice@example.com");
    // ...
}

Here, myapp::models::user::User specifies the path to the User type defined in user.rs.

Note that Rust does not have a strict convention for organizing modules and files, so you can choose a directory structure that makes sense for your particular project. However, organizing data models in their own subdirectory is a common practice in Rust.
-
what does `mod foo` do in rust and where is it written
-
In Rust, the syntax mod foo is used to declare a module named foo. A module is a way to organize code in Rust, and it allows you to group related functionality together.

You can use the mod keyword in a few different ways. Here are a couple of examples:

You can use mod to declare a module in the same file where you're using it. For example:

csharp
Copy code
mod foo {
    // Define functions, structs, and other items here.
}

fn main() {
    // Use functions and other items from the foo module here.
}
You can use mod to declare a submodule inside an existing module. For example:

rust
mod foo {
    mod bar {
        // Define functions, structs, and other items here.
    }
}
In both cases, the mod declaration is followed by a block of code that defines the module or submodule.

You can find examples of mod declarations in Rust code files, which usually have a .rs extension. The location of the file where the mod declaration is written will depend on the project's directory structure and how the module is being used.
-
does a new file in src need to have mod line at the strat
-
In Rust, if you create a new file in the src directory of your Rust project, you don't necessarily need to have a mod declaration at the beginning of the file.

By default, Rust treats each file in the src directory as a separate module. This means that any code defined in the file is not visible outside the file unless it is explicitly exported.

However, if you want to use code from another module in your Rust project, you will need to create a mod declaration for that module. For example, if you have a file called foo.rs in the src directory and you want to use it in another module, you would create a mod declaration like this:

lua
Copy code
mod foo;
This tells Rust to treat foo.rs as a module and make its code available for use in other parts of your program.

If you don't need to use the code in the file from other modules in your Rust project, you don't need to create a mod declaration for it.

how do i import libraries in rust
-
In Rust, you can import external libraries (called "crates" in Rust) by adding them to your project's Cargo.toml file.

Here's an example of how to add the chrono crate to your Rust project:

Open your project's Cargo.toml file.

Under the [dependencies] section, add the following line:

makefile
Copy code
chrono = "0.4.19"
This tells Cargo to download and include the chrono crate in your project.

Save the Cargo.toml file.

After you've added the crate to your Cargo.toml file, you can use the use keyword in your Rust code to import specific items from the crate. Here's an example of how to import the DateTime type from the chrono crate:
-
is there no way to get this to automatically be added to cargo.toml for standard libraries? Something analogous to go-autoimport
-
Rust's cargo build system does not have a feature to automatically add dependencies for standard libraries to the Cargo.toml file.

The Rust language design philosophy is to keep the standard library minimal, so that developers have the freedom to choose external crates based on their needs. Additionally, the standard library is stable and backwards compatible, so there is less need to specify exact version numbers.

However, you can still use external tools or editors to help you manage dependencies and imports in your Rust projects. For example, some text editors or IDEs may have features that can automatically import missing symbols or suggest adding missing dependencies to your Cargo.toml file.

There are also command-line tools available that can help with managing Rust dependencies. For example, the cargo-edit tool provides commands for adding, removing, and updating dependencies in your Cargo.toml file.

sh
Copy code
cargo install cargo-edit
cargo add crate_name
This will add the specified crate to your Cargo.toml file as a dependency.
